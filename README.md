# Toast Notification

https://thedanitor.github.io/toast_notification/

This project is from the Day 27 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

Simple project, but could be useful for notifying user about input status. It made more sense to me to make the random message and type be variables rather than functions so I did that.
